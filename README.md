## Why I implemented redux in this demo even though it is not a good fit?
Because I only treat it as a practice for using redux, I have no intention to expand it to something bigger and fancier, like building a real website. 

## Tech used:
1. Html, CSS and JavaScript.
2. React.js
3. Redux
4. Styled-components

## Set up
1. npm install
2. npm run start
